## Description:
The purpose of this application is to offer a website that small businesses can use to store all their clientâ€™s information, the already scheduled appointments, a glance at their monthly schedule and the ability to add new appointments.

The CMS application that we created is geared towards small business owners, this example specifically for a salon. There is log in / authentication required to use the appliation to keep all personal information safe from the prying eyes of the internet. Once the account owner has logged in you are able to view all your client's saved contact information, see their scheduled appointments and schedule then for an upcoming appointment as well. On the client's contact card you are able to edit any of the information or even delete their contact card if you wish to.
